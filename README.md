# Anonymous Work Code

Two Files:

 * [masterimport.py](https://github.com/cjacks04/ZooData/blob/master/AnonWork/masterimport.py)
 * [DataMunging_Results_Anon.R](https://github.com/cjacks04/ZooData/blob/master/AnonWork/DataMunging_Results_Anon.R)

The masterimport.py is Python code to import the data from mongodb as .csv and computes annotation number, session number for each annotation, and time between annotations.

The DataMunging_Results_Anon.R file does most of the analysis of building charts/graphs and contribution statistics for the paper.
